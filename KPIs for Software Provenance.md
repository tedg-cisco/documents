Creating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Software Bills of Materials (SBOM) provenance using the SMART criteria involves developing specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound metrics. Here is a detailed plan for KPIs:

### 1. **KPI: Completeness of SBOM Entries**

**Specific:** Ensure every component used in the software is documented in the SBOM.

**Measurable:** Track the percentage of software components included in the SBOM.

**Achievable:** Set a realistic target based on current completeness levels and improvement capabilities.

**Relevant:** Accurate SBOMs are essential for transparency, security, and compliance.

**Time-bound:** Achieve 100% completeness within the next six months.

- **Baseline Measurement:** Determine the current percentage of completeness.
- **Target:** 100% completeness.
- **Data Collection Method:** Automated scanning tools and manual audits.
- **Reporting Frequency:** Monthly.

### 2. **KPI: Timeliness of SBOM Updates**

**Specific:** Ensure SBOMs are updated promptly when new components are added or existing components are modified.

**Measurable:** Measure the time between a change in the software and the corresponding update in the SBOM.

**Achievable:** Define a reasonable time frame for updates based on current processes and potential for improvement.

**Relevant:** Timely updates are critical for maintaining up-to-date and accurate software inventories.

**Time-bound:** Achieve an average update time of less than 24 hours within the next three months.

- **Baseline Measurement:** Current average time for SBOM updates.
- **Target:** Less than 24 hours.
- **Data Collection Method:** Track timestamps of software changes and SBOM updates.
- **Reporting Frequency:** Weekly.

### 3. **KPI: Accuracy of Component Provenance Information**

**Specific:** Ensure all provenance information (origin, version, licensing, etc.) in the SBOM is accurate.

**Measurable:** Track the number of inaccuracies found during audits compared to the total number of components.

**Achievable:** Set a target for reducing inaccuracies based on current error rates.

**Relevant:** Accurate provenance information is crucial for security, compliance, and risk management.

**Time-bound:** Reduce inaccuracies to less than 1% within the next four months.

- **Baseline Measurement:** Current rate of inaccuracies.
- **Target:** Less than 1% inaccuracies.
- **Data Collection Method:** Periodic audits and cross-checks with verified sources.
- **Reporting Frequency:** Quarterly.

### 4. **KPI: Compliance with Industry Standards**

**Specific:** Ensure the SBOM meets relevant industry standards and regulatory requirements (e.g., NTIA, ISO, NIST).

**Measurable:** Track the compliance status against each standard.

**Achievable:** Identify gaps and develop a plan to address them.

**Relevant:** Compliance with standards ensures legal and regulatory adherence and enhances trust.

**Time-bound:** Achieve full compliance within the next six months.

- **Baseline Measurement:** Current compliance status.
- **Target:** Full compliance with identified standards.
- **Data Collection Method:** Compliance audits and reviews.
- **Reporting Frequency:** Bi-monthly.

### 5. **KPI: Security Vulnerability Identification**

**Specific:** Ensure the SBOM is used to identify and address security vulnerabilities in software components.

**Measurable:** Track the number of vulnerabilities identified and remediated based on the SBOM.

**Achievable:** Set realistic goals for vulnerability management based on current capabilities.

**Relevant:** Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities is critical for maintaining software security.

**Time-bound:** Identify and remediate 90% of known vulnerabilities within one month of detection.

- **Baseline Measurement:** Current rate of vulnerability identification and remediation.
- **Target:** 90% remediation within one month.
- **Data Collection Method:** Vulnerability scanning tools and tracking systems.
- **Reporting Frequency:** Monthly.

### 6. **KPI: User Training and Awareness**

**Specific:** Ensure all relevant personnel are trained on SBOM management and its importance.

**Measurable:** Track the percentage of personnel who have completed SBOM training.

**Achievable:** Set a target based on the number of personnel and training resources available.

**Relevant:** Training ensures that staff understand the importance of SBOMs and how to manage them effectively.

**Time-bound:** Achieve 100% training completion within the next three months.

- **Baseline Measurement:** Current training completion rate.
- **Target:** 100% of relevant personnel trained.
- **Data Collection Method:** Training attendance records and quizzes.
- **Reporting Frequency:** Monthly.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Define Roles and Responsibilities:**
   - Assign a project manager to oversee KPI implementation.
   - Identify team members responsible for data collection, analysis, and reporting.

2. **Develop Data Collection Processes:**
   - Establish automated tools and manual processes for collecting relevant data.
   - Create standardized templates and procedures for data entry and reporting.

3. **Set Up Reporting Mechanisms:**
   - Implement dashboards or reporting tools to visualize KPI performance.
   - Schedule regular meetings to review KPI progress and address issues.

4. **Conduct Training and Awareness Programs:**
   - Develop training materials and schedule sessions for relevant personnel.
   - Ensure ongoing education and refreshers to maintain high awareness levels.

5. **Monitor and Adjust KPIs:**
   - Regularly review KPI performance and adjust targets or processes as needed.
   - Ensure continuous improvement by addressing any identified gaps or challenges.

By following this detailed plan, organizations can effectively implement and track KPIs for SBOM provenance, ensuring they meet SMART criteria and contribute to overall software security and compliance.
